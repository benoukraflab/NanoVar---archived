HS-BLASTN produces the same results as MegaBLAST.
However, if there is one query having two or more alignments whose e-values and bit-scores are all identical, then HS-BLASTN and MegaBLAST might output these alignments in different orders.
So that simply comparing HS-BLASTN's outputs and MegaBLAST's outputs by using the "diff" tool may not yields our claim.

To verify that HS-BLASTN produces the same results as MegaBLAST, one can first sort the output results using the "sort" tool, and then compare their sorted results using the "diff" tool.
For example, to verify that the following two commands:

  hs-blastn align -db hg38.fa -window_masker_db hg38.fa.counts.obinary -query HSQueriesSmall.fa -out hs-blastn_results_small.txt -outfmt 6
  blastn -task megablast -db hg38.fa -window_masker_db hg38.fa.counts.obinary -query HSQueriesSmall.fa -out megablast_results_small.txt -outfmt 6

produce the same results, we can perform the following 3 commands in order:

  sort hs-blastn_results_small.txt > sorted_hs-blastn_results_small.txt
  sort megablast_results_small.txt > sorted_megablast_results_small.txt
  diff sorted_hs-blastn_results_small.txt sorted_megablast_results_small.txt

This method only works for output format 6 and format 7. That is, the argument to the option -outfmt must be 6 or 7.
